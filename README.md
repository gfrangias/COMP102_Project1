# Linked Lists in C
Two exercises on linked lists in C

## Exercise 1
* The user is guided to create a custom linked list of "N" nodes, that is printed
* The user is asked to enter an integer "n"
* The program searches the linked list and makes changes as detailed below:
> If the number is found as a node value and the next node has a bigger value, the "n" valued node is being pushed back to the end of the linked list, else nothing changes
* The user is informed about the changes 
* The new linked list is printed

## Exercise 2
* The user is guided to create a custom linked list of "N" nodes, that is printed
* The program crosses the linked list, starting from the first node, and checks if the value of each node is a factor of the sum of the values of the next nodes
* Then the linked list is printed backwards and for every value the sum and the validity of the statement above (Yes/No) are printed
